        <h2>THE LION IN LOVE</h2>

        <p>The Lion, by chance, saw a fair Maid, the forester's daughter, as she
was tripping over a lawn, and fell in love with her. Nay, so violent was
his passion, that he could not live unless he made her his own; so that,
without any more delay, he broke his mind to the father, and demanded
the damsel for his wife. The man, as odd as the proposal seemed at
first, yet soon recollected, that by complying he might get the Lion
into his power; but, by refusing him, should only exasperate and provoke
his rage. Therefore he consented; but told him it must be upon these
conditions: that, considering the girl was young and tender, he must
agree to let his teeth be plucked out, and his claws cut off, lest he
should hurt her, or at least frighten her, with the apprehension of
them. The Lion was too much in love to hesitate; but was no sooner
deprived of his teeth and claws, than the treacherous forester attacked
him with a huge club, and knocked his brains out.</p>
